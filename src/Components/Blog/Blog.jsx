            <h3>1. Props vs state </h3>
            <p>Ans: The difference between Props and state is that, The state is owned locally, and the component itself updates it. Props are owned and read only by a parent. Props can be changed only if an upstream shift is caused by a callback function passed on to the child.</p>

            <h3>2. How does useState work? </h3>
            <p>Ans: useState is React Hook that allows you to add state to a functional component. It returns an array with two values: the current state and a function to update it. The Hook takes an initial state value as an argument and returns an updated state value whenever the setter function is called.</p>

            <h3>3. Purpose of useEffect other than fetching data. </h3>
            <p>Ans: The useEffect in react js allows you to perform side effects in your components. The react useEffect examples of side effects include retrieving data, direct DOM updates, and timers.</p>

            <h3>4. How Does React work?</h3>
            <p>Ans: ReactJS divides the UI into isolated reusable pieces of code known as components. React components work similarly to JavaScript functions as they accept arbitrary inputs called properties or props.</p>
